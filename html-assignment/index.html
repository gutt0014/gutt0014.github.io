        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <b>Kaitlynn</b>, I am from Southern, Ontario but have been living in Arnprior for 4 years. My
            birthday is October 8<sup>th</sup>, I will be 25 this year. In 2017, I attended Algonquin College and
            graduated in 2019 with a diploma in the program <em>Baking and Pastry Arts Managment</em>. I have also taken
            a <em>Pre-Health Sciences</em> program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>, but the health field is
            not for me. I decided to come back to school so that I can explore my creative side more.

            <p>
                I have a Bengal Cat named <b>Hank</b>, he was born on January 28<sup>th</sup>, 2023. I have only one
                silbing, her name is <b>Nikkole</b>, she is four years older than me. Baking is my passion but I can not
                do the job as I have three screws in my ankle from being in a car accident.
